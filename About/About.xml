        GlitterTech adds a ton of shiny new and futuristic items found on the richer developed Glitter worlds. But, this
        expensive and illegal tech attracts attention of Glitter world Commandos.

        (Unofficial Version for 1.4 and below)

        Original Mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725576127
        Pulled and updated from: 725576127 mod folder
        Original Git Repo: https://github.com/sam23694/GlitterTech/tree/1.0.2059
        Current Mod Repo: https://github.com/mdrain18/XaviorsGlitterTech.git

        Updating Mod:
        It can be said this mod is OP. I think it should be, however, in the spirit of being able to play how you want
        to I am adding a few changes to this mod.

            1) Updating to 1.4 (in progress)
                - Known issues
                    - Tanks removed (working on this now)
                        - which means its buggy as hell
                    - Some problems with the factions (working on this now)
                - Blackmarket trader is back
                (let me know if there are problems)
                - Made things less OP
            2) Adding slider: this will increase everything by a multiplier. (in progress)
            1x: Default, which doesn't change anything
            2x: Max, doubles everything (not recommended)
            .1x: Makes everything suck
            3) Individual sliders: this will target specific items, like beta or alpha poly and allow you to configure
            the individual stats of each item
            4) Craft Glitter Tech: there is a mod for this already but I wanted to add the ability to this mod with the
            ability to turn it on or off. This will be different and require special items only
            found through questing. Similar to relics...
            5) More..... STUFF! Starting with Glitter swords and Glitter psycasts... I think. Not sure if I will ever get
            here but I'm being optimistic

        Let me know in the "Changes" discussion what you want done with this mod and I will do my best to make it
        happen. Link below:

        Release Notes: 1.4.01
            - Item values have been updated. Items are easier to craft, but are not as OP as they were before.
                I'm sure this will need to be further balanced so let me know your thoughts.
            - Updated to 1.4: Except:
                - Tanks: big problems here
                - Factions are buggy
                - Black Market Trader - TraderKindDefs is throwing a no constructor error. Which means:
                    1) I will have to write the constructor class
                    2) RimWorld patches their code
                    3) Or someone else will tell me I'm wrong and I need to do it a different way :)
