        (Unofficial Version for 1.4 and below) I am not the original author
        GlitterTech adds a ton of shiny new and futuristic items found on the richer developed Glitter worlds. But, this
        expensive and illegal tech attracts attention of Glitter world Commandos.

        Pulled and updated from: 725576127 mod folder
        Original Git Repo: https://github.com/sam23694/GlitterTech/tree/1.0.2059

        Updating Mod:
        It can be said this mod is OP. I think it should be, however, in the spirt of being able to play how you want to
        I am adding a few changes to this mod.

        1) Updating to 1.4 (in progress)
        2) Adding slider: this will increase everything by a multiplier. (in progress)
            1x: Default, which doesn't change anything
            2x: Max, doubles everything (not recommended) 
           .1x: Makes everything suck
        3) Individual sliders: this will target specific items, like beta or alpha poly and allow you to configure
            the individual stats of each item
        4) Craft Glitter Tech: there is a mod for this already but I wanted to add the ability to this mod with the
            ability to turn it on or off. This will be different and require special items only
            found through questing. Similar to relics...
        5) More..... STUFF! Starting with Glitter swords and Glitter psycasts... I think. Not sure if I will ever get
            here but I'm being optimistic
        
        Let me know in the "Changes" discussion what you want done with this mod and I will do my best to make it 
        happen. Link below:
